Continuous vs discrete WT

-Continuous in CWT indicates all possible in teger factors of shifting and stretching (e.g. by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.)
-Discrete WT stretch and shift by powers of 2.

Continuous CWT uses only the one wavelet filter
	- we have one correlation value for every shift of everty strached wavelet.
	- to show correlation values (quality of the "match") for all these stretches and shifts, we use a 3-D display.
	
UDWT (undecimated discrete wavelet transform)
	- 4 filters (two low & two high) splited into 2 parts: 
		-decomposition (forward transform)
		-reconstruction (inverse transform) 
			also some additional decomposition and reconstruction can be inserted, producing higher level UDWTs
	- stretching is done only by factors of 2

	DWT (conventional discrete wavelet transform)
		- DWT is similar to the UDWT, but produces downsampling and thus potental aliasing problems.
		- becouse of the aliasing problems we need to be careful by choosing correct wavelet (Haar, Shannon, Daubechies, Coiflet, etc.)
		
		
"Decomposition" in wavelet terminology means spliting the signal into 2 parts using highpass and a lowpass filter. Each of the 2 parts themselves can be decomposed further (split into more parts) using more filters.

"Reconstruction" means using filters to to combine the parts.
