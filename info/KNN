 K - nearest neighbors (KNN)
 
	Calculate Euclidean distance between all dataset points (one by one) and new data point
	sqrt((x(i) - x2)^2 + (y(i) - y(2))^2 + (z(i) - z(2))^2) = C(i)
	
	min{C(i)} = k 	<-  k-th cluster
	
	- before calculation, data must be normalized  (x-min(x))/(min(x) â€” max(x))
	- when we split our data to training and test data sets, data needs to be normalzied before split
	- KNN is supervised learning algorithm that works on classification problems
