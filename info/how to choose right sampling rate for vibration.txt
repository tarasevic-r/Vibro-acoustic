There are 3 important parameters that have to be controlled in order to obtain useful measurements for analysis; they are:
	-Sampling rate
	-Sampling time
	-Number of samples
	
The sampling rate is the frequency at which measurements are captured from the sensor or transducer.

The sampling time is the length of time used for taking measurements.

The number of samples refers to the quantity of individual measurements recorded.

The sampling rate, sampling time and number of samples are related as follows: Sampling rate x Sampling time = Number of samples

When selecting the sampling rate, the rule of thumb is that it should be 2.56 times greater than the highest frequency that you want to measure; this is known as the Nyquist Frequency.

For example: if you wanted to record a signal with a frequency of 100 Hz, you would have to select a sampling rate of: 100 Hz x 2.56 = 256 Hz
