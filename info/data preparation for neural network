DATA PREPARATION FOR NEURAL NETWORK

		- All data needs to be vectorized, and the vectors should be the same length when they enter the neural net.
		- The minimums vary with the complexity of the problem, but 100,000 instances in total, across all categories, is a good place to start.
		- If you have labeled data (i.e. categories A, B, C and D), itâ€™s preferable to have an evenly balanced dataset with 25,000 instances of each label; 
		that is, 25,000 instances of A, 25,000 instances of B and so forth.
		- Handling missing data
		- Extract features
		- Splitting the data into training & testing sets
	
	

	Three common data preprocessing steps are: 
		-formatting; 
		-cleaning;
		-sampling.
	
	The final step is to transform the process data.
	Three common data transformations are:
		-normalization;
			Four common normalization techniques may be useful:
				-scaling to a range (When the feature is more-or-less uniformly distributed across a fixed range.)
				-clipping (When the feature contains some extreme outliers.)
				-log scaling (When the feature conforms to the power law.)
				-z-score (When the feature distribution does not contain extreme outliers.)
	
		-attribute decompositions;
			There may be features that represent a complex concept that may be more useful to a machine learning 
			method when split into the constituent parts. An example is a date that may have day and time components 
			that in turn could be split out further. Perhaps only the hour of day is relevant to the problem being solved.
			consider what feature decompositions you can perform.
			
		-attribute aggregations.
			There may be features that can be aggregated into a single feature that would be more meaningful to the problem 
			you are trying to solve. For example, there may be a data instances for each time a customer logged into a system 
			that could be aggregated into a count for the number of logins allowing the additional instances to be discarded. 
			Consider what type of feature aggregations could perform.
