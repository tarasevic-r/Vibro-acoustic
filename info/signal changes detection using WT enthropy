Notice signals behaviour changes using wavelets coefficients entrophy

We were trying to find out when signal behaviour is changing. Simulated 256 data points, 74hz signal with "glitch" (14hz) in a middle of signal
wavelet transform was performed on data window = 16 with slide dw/4 signal and calculated signal mean and  entrophy of gained coefficients on each data window. 
Proposal was that entrophy should be similar in a whole data samples (if signal behaviour is similar) and should be different if it founds a glitch.
Results showed significant changes in entrophy where glitch was simulated, while mean changes werent significant.

It could be good method for signal changes noticing, but more testing would be needed to verify sensitivity.
