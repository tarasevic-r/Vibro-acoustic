# A major disadvantage for the KPSS test is that it has a high rate of Type I errors (it tends to reject the null hypothesis too often). If attempts are made to control these errors (by having larger p-values), then that negatively impacts the testâ€™s power.
# One way to deal with the potential for high Type I errors is to combine the KPSS with an ADF test. If the result from both tests suggests that the time series in stationary, then it probably is.
